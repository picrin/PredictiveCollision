PredictiveCollision
===================
- This is a snippet of python code that solves collisions of circular objects using continuous (a priori) approach. Trajectories of the circles are straight lines. The code makes heavy use of linear algebra. Apart from standard library it depends on numpy and pygame, so make sure you install these dependencies before running it.
- This code is under development by folks from Glasgow University Tech Society. To visit our society's fb page follow the link www.facebook.com/gutechsoc, to join discussion on development of this piece of code follow the link www.fb.com/groups/scientificProgramming, to contact the original developer please drop an e-mail to adam /at\ kurkiewicz /d0t\ pl or follow the facebook link www.fb.com/pikryn.
- For newcomers, from GUTS or from around the web, the best place to start (especially if you're python beginners) is a file intro.py in "introduction" folder.
- The code is BSD licenced, read LICENCE for more detailes.
- WARNING! PRE-ALPHA -- NOT PRODUCTION READY. The code is not fully debugged/functional, there are many known issues, which will be addressed shortly.
